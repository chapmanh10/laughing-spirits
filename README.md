## <a name="about-the-project"></a>About the Project
Laughing Spirits provides the user with a chance to combine humor and intoxication! We allow users to pick a type of alcoholic beverage and depending on the beverage, a joke displays on screen! (Description)
<br>
Laughing always lightens the mood and alcohol enhances those laughs. Why not make a program that combines the two!(Motivation for Development?)
<br>

### User Story:
As a party person I want to find a random cocktail recipe that also gives me a reason to laugh
<br>
When I visit the Laughing Spirits landing page then I am presented with 4 liquors to choose from
<br>
When I click on a liquor then a random cocktail displays with a picture of the drink, the ingredients, and the recipe instructions
<br>
When a cocktail is displayed, the user is also presented with a random joke
<br>
When I see a cocktail I like, I can save it to local storage
